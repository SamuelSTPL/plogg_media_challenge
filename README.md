Hi and welcome to my repo!

I have built a simple calculator using vue.js!

Altought it seems simple enough, I made sure that everything is fully accessible and I left plenty of comments to explain everything that is going on!

If I was to keep working on this app, I would probably start by spliting everything into reusable components
(ex: create a component called button and render it twice with different props).

Then, adding more functionnalities! 
(ex: substraction, etc.)
